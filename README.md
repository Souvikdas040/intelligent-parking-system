## Overview

The **Intelligent Parking System (IPS)** is a web application that manages a parking lot digitally.  
It models each **parking slot** and **vehicle** as entities and automates:

- Slot initialization (normal, handicap, EV)
- Parking of incoming vehicles
- Unparking and releasing slots
- Displaying live slot status on a dashboard

The project is designed as a **learning-friendly** yet **industry-style** Spring Boot app that can later be connected to sensors, a mobile app, or payment gateways.

## Features

- 🔹 **Digital Parking Lot Representation**
  - Each slot is stored in the database with type, occupancy, and reservation status.
- 🔹 **Automatic Slot Allocation**
  - Picks the most suitable free slot based on vehicle type and slot category.
- 🔹 **Park / Unpark Operations**
  - REST endpoints to park a vehicle and unpark it.
- 🔹 **Real-Time Status Dashboard**
  - Tailwind CSS UI to visualize slots (free/occupied/reserved).
- 🔹 **Extensible Architecture**
  - Service-oriented, ready for IoT, payment, and analytics integration.

## Architecture

High-level layers:

1. **Client Layer**
   - HTML + Tailwind CSS + Vanilla JS dashboard.
2. **REST API Layer**
   - `ParkingController` exposes endpoints for status, park, and unpark.
3. **Service Layer**
   - `ParkingManager` implements all parking logic and rules.
4. **Data Access Layer**
   - Spring Data JPA repositories (`ParkingSlotRepository`, `VehicleRepository`).
5. **Database Layer**
   - H2 (in-memory) or MySQL for persistent storage.
